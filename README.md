# Sorting-Algorithms-with-time-calculation-
This is a program which compares all sorting algorithms by measuring the time taken by each of them.
For measuring time I had used time.h library which contains definitions of functions to get and  manipulate date and time information.
Function rand() is also used for the purpose of generating random numbers to perform the sorting.
If you want to check the random numbers generated by rand just uncommenting the line 172-173. 
To check the sorted random numbers uncomment line 198-199
** Note : For best results use Linux based environment or online compilers.
