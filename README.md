# Sorting-Algorithms-with-time-calculation-
This is a program which compares all sorting algorithms by measuring the time taken by each of them.<br />
For measuring time I had used time.h library which contains definitions of functions to get and  manipulate date and time information.<br />
Function rand() is also used for the purpose of generating random numbers to perform the sorting.<br />
If you want to check the random numbers generated by rand just uncommenting the line 172-173.<br />
To check the sorted random numbers uncomment line 198-199.<br />
** Note : For best results use Linux based environment or online compilers.<br />
